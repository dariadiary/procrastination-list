# Procrastination List — A Cute Anti-Productivity App

## Project Description
Procrastination List is a minimalist and cozy React app designed for jotting down tasks that you don’t really have to rush to complete

The visual style is warm and intentionally lazy — inspired by cute cats and a relaxed “do it later” mood.
Illustrations in this project were generated with AI (ChatGPT) to support the visual concept of the app.


**Technologies used:**
- React (class-based components)
- CSS3 (custom styling, Flexbox layout, responsive design, media queries)
- Vite (build tool)
- Netlify (deployment)

**Planned future improvements:**
- Smooth animations for adding, crossing out, and deleting tasks
- Theme switching (e.g. Lazy Cat, Crazy Cat, Cute Paw, Coffee Mode)
- LocalStorage support so tasks persist after page reload
- Sound effects (like a soft meow when crossing out a task)

## How to Use
The app is intentionally simple and intuitive:

**Add a task:**
- click the **"Fine, Add it"** button  
- or press **Enter**

**Cross out a task:**
- single click on the task

**Delete a task:**
- double-click on the task

**Delete all tasks:**
- click **"Let it All Go"**

The app is fully responsive and works smoothly on mobile devices.
